# --- Important Note for GPU Users ---
# The 'torch' and 'torchvision' entries above will typically install the CPU-only versions.
# If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to use it for significantly faster training,
# you MUST install PyTorch with CUDA support specifically.
#
# Please visit the official PyTorch website to get the correct installation command
# for your operating system and CUDA version:
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#
# An example command (for CUDA 11.8 on Windows/Linux) might look like:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
